                                            talents. It offers practice spaces and a wide array of instruments that are
                                            safely stored. This place is full of positive energy and enthusiasm.
                                            Learners love to engage in different activities such as singing and playing
                                            musical instruments. They connect beats and notes of the music to form
                                            rhythm in their everyday activities. We also prepare learners for various

                        <p>Outside the classroom, children participate in activities that allow them to hone specific talents and demonstrate their hidden inner abilities. Students obtain theoretical and practical experience in the performing arts as a result of their studies.

                        "Teach me, and I will forget, show me, and I might remember. Involve me, and I will never forget." is a very apt proverb in the case of performing arts. Cultural activities help students to develop their overall personality. They gain self-confidence, and the necessary resources provided to them help them develop their specific abilities to achieve a successful life.
                            
                        Students tend to learn and are inspired by music, dance, and performing arts. They get an understanding of different cultures and have an improved sense of the self. Cultural activities help students realise their optimum potential and identify their talents and interests outside of the classroom.</p>

                        <p>Gyan Anant Vidyalaya's environmental studies begin with the importance of maintaining a healthy environment. Students are introduced to an understanding of the five elements - earth, sky, air, fire, and water. Environmental awareness activities such as resource protection, conservation, preservation, and restoration are conducted.<br>

                            Besides in class room teaching students get hands on practical learning opportunities too, where students learn about various curriculum related concepts such as how groundwater is recharged and collected from paved areas, how to use conserved water for gardening, sanitization, collection of rainwater from rooftops for subterranean recharging and LED/CFL to save electricity etc. All this is learnt under the supervision of professional teachers.<br>
                            
                            Students are encouraged, to avoid using plastic bags to dispose trash near their homes, schools, and eating establishments. We also encourage our students to plant a sapling on their birthdayâ€™s either at home or at school while also inculcating the tradition of gifting saplings to their loved ones on celebratory occasions</p>

                        <p>Value-based learning provides an environment that fosters studentâ€™s academic success besides developing lifelong social and personal relationship skills. The positive attitude of teachers encourages students to develop a sense of security and affection, which provide a firm basis for inculcating other core values.<br>

                        â€˜Value Educationâ€™ is a socialisation process that youngsters experience through songs, plays, conversations, project themes, incentive systems, appreciation, storytelling, cultural activities, festival celebrations and so on. Respect, love, honesty, unity, cooperation, courage, friendship, appreciation, patience, trust, optimism, happiness and peace, aids in the development of reflective learners and the growth of civilised citizens.</p>

                        <h5>Cultural Activities</h5>
                        <p>Outside the classroom, children participate in activities that allow them to hone specific talents and demonstrate their hidden inner abilities. Students obtain theoretical and practical experience in the performing arts as a result of their own studies.<br>

                        "Teach me, and I will forget, show me, and I might remember. Involve me, and I will never forget." is a very apt proverb in the case of performing arts. Cultural activities help students to develop their overall personality. They gain self-confidence, and the necessary resources provided to them help them develop their specific abilities to achieve a successful life.<br>
                            
                        Students tend to learn and are inspired by music, dance, and performing arts. They get an understanding of different cultures and have an improved sense of the self. Cultural activities help students realise their optimum potential and identify their talents and interests outside of the classroom.</p>
