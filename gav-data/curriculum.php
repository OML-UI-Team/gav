                        <h5>Curriculum Introduction</h5>
                        <p>To bring together the traditions and ethos of India with modern technology in an environment
where every child is an individual. Gyan Anant Vidyalaya (recognized school) is a day school
that offers English medium, secular, co-educational education from classes Nursery to VIII. The
school provides excellent facilities and the best education to its students. We make sure a quality
atmosphere for students.</p>
<p>There is no better place for a child to appreciate the joys of nature and to become
environmentally conscious. The view of the lush green forest from the School, an abundance of
trees, and the chatter of a myriad variety of birds enhance the joy of learning. We believe that
responding positively to the genuine needs of our students determines our success.</p>

                        <p>We provide a stimulating academic framework that emphasizes individual conscientiousness and
respects individuality in its creative inference. The school curriculum not only facilitates seamless
progress from formative years through schooling but also encourages students to be hands-on
learners who scrutinize, fathom and engage in the world around them. It lays conscious effort
towards inculcating non-cognitive skills such as leadership, conflict resolution, self-discipline, and
ethical decision-making in tandem with technical abilities vital to excel in professional pursuits.
Time table is finagled in such a way that the child grasps the concepts along with a balanced
focus on co-curricular activities. Learners are sensitized about environmental issues through a
direct curriculum of EVS and interlinking of subjects. We specifically focus on Sustainable
Development Goals by engaging learners in different activities such as Plantation Drives,
Cleanliness Campaigns, Social Work, Waste Management, Discussions, and Debates throughout
the year. The curriculum of GAV focuses on developing an educational program and environment
which nurtures our young learners who strive to be good citizens and distinguish themselves in all
walks of life.</p>

                        <h5>Clubs</h5>
                        <p>School clubs create small communities. They attract students who share the same interests such as in music, arts, or sports. Club activities help students develop a sense of unity and teamwork, learning how to work with others in reaching the same goals. They help learners develop social skills. Clubs enable students to meet, mix, and collaborate with other students from different age groups. They are pushed outside of their comfort zone and encouraged to socialize with people they are not very familiar with. Though the first meetings and activities may seem awkward for them, they will soon form meaningful relationships and friendships, which is vital in the lives of adolescents. Students become more confident and independent. Gyan Anant Vidyalaya Clubs have a special feature as each club is based on any one or two SDGs and will work throughout the year on this concept to sensitize students about that particular SDG. The Clubs are as follows:
