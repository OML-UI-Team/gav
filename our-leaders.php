                            Welcome to Gyan Anant Vidyalaya. We intend to make our students future leaders and responsible citizens. It is our endeavour to inculcate values, knowledge, and sensitivity towards mother earth and all fellow human beings. Since its inception, Gyan Anant Vidyalaya has always combined academic excellence with practical knowledge to enable students to become global citizens. Our institution was formed by the service-oriented organization, Mobius Foundation, to develop and enhance a deep bond between mankind and nature, tradition and modernity, knowledge and working skills. As an established and highly esteemed institution, we maintain an excellent academic standard. However, we understand that discipline and cultural values are important aspects of grooming an individual and go hand in hand. The current environmental crises like global warming, pollution, loss of biodiversity, deforestation, depletion of resources- water and land are going to be a challenge for the future of our younger generation. 

                            Thus, we encourage our children to develop a deep understanding of these issues and to help regenerate the resources of nature, to develop an attitude of reducing carbon emission, to help achieve the goal of the global community of carbon neutrality. We also teach them to use modern technology with a sense of responsibility, commitment and for the larger welfare of mankind.

                            As a chairperson of this institution, I solicit the full participation and cooperation of each student and parent to make it possible for us to transform these dreams into reality. We can do it, only if we do it together. We believe that the investment we put into our children today in terms of these values, goals, and understanding, will help them achieve greater heights and create a sustainable world where people and nature will coexist in perfect peace and harmony.</p>

                      <p>In my fifty years of working with and leading schools like Mayo College, Genesis Global School and in my experiences abroad, Gyan Anant Vidyalaya is a school which stands out due to its focus on
                        environmentalism and efforts for a sustainable future. This is in addition to giving a robust academic and co-curricular education to its students. It is heartening to see that such an education is being provided to students of diverse backgrounds who are often economically impoverished. The need of such an education comes at a time when it is required most for our future. The world is at a tipping point and humanity’s only hope is education – a group of dedicated citizens of tomorrow who will work for this idea of global change whose time has come. The attention of the school to sports education is commendable and that will ensure the holistic development of every child. Their community service program encourages every child to think of their contribution to the society from a young age and will help them grow into responsible adults.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pradip Burman, Ms. Indira Burman and the Mobius Foundation have a formidable reputation in
                            the field of sustainability and caring for our planet. It is natural that the school being led by their beliefs will emulate the same. It is an honour to be associated with this project and I wish the Principal, faculty members, parents and students my warm wishes for their excellent future.</p>

                            Benjamin Disraeli perfectly elucidates the purpose of our actions and thoughts. It is after
                            all, our decisions, actions and thoughts that mold us into the individuals that we are

						<p>India’s tradition and history has laid down the roots of education in the country. Our
                            culture depends on a sound education to produce the best minds which are spread
                            across the globe. Internationally, the world is going through major changes, but India is
                            at a juncture where education is not an exception, but a necessity. Gyan Anant
                            Vidyalaya firmly believes in an education that engages the head, heart and soul of its
                            students. GAV is a beautiful intermingling of technology with nature where students learn
                            in an environment that helps them grow in the most desirable of ways.

                    long way in ensuring a fruitful academic experience. The school’s ultimate theme centers
                    around sustainable development goals which are inculcated in students from the very

                    our well-developed curriculum, GAV, offers students a perfect opportunity to discover the
                    power within themselves. The wide range of activities helps students develop motor,
                    emotional, intellectual and spiritual aspects of their personalities in the best possible
                    way. Keeping in mind the upcoming global trends, we train students in languages,
                    number skills, sciences and cultural arts. Armed with information for students to
                    succeed in their lives, we also attempt to keep alive the wonder and thrill of discovering

                    their way. We also aim to build individuals who are not only well informed, but those
                    whose feet are firmly rooted in Indian tradition and culture. As a school community, we
                    can collectively imbibe the traditions of the past and scale new heights through
                    innovative and exciting ways in the future.</p>
                <p>GAV believes in nurturing intellectual curiosity and academic potential in its students to

                    creating a safer world for children and future generations to live in. Unless we do not
                    impart a holistic education that focuses on sensible living and vocational learning, we
                    cannot contribute towards giving back to the environment and curb the impending
                    climate crisis.</p>
